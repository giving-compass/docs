## Overview

The Giving Compass Insights API provides access to nonprofit data, impact stories, financial information, and AI-powered search capabilities.

## Authentication

All endpoints require an API key passed via the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
```

## Core Capabilities

### Nonprofit Search
Search and filter nonprofits by location, revenue, expenses, cause areas, and Charity Navigator ratings. Use Natural language search for nonprofits and content. Example queries:
- `Find articles about clean water`
- `Find nonprofits in Chicago with revenue over 100k`
- `Show nonprofits in TX that help the blind`
- `Nonprofits that are similar to JDRF`
- `Nonprofits that focus on SDG 5 with revenue between 1M and 5M`

### Impact Data
Access AI-extracted impact stories and metrics from nonprofit annual reports:
- **Stories**: Human transformation narratives with emotional hooks, quotes, and before/after states
- **Metrics**: Quantitative measures (people served, meals distributed, volunteers, etc.)

### Feed Data
Access and filter nonprofit posts (articles, events, videos, job postings) from organizations:
- **Content Types**: Filter by classification (articles, videos, events, podcasts, job postings, volunteer opportunities)
- **Location Filtering**: Filter posts by nonprofit's city, county, state, ZIP code, or geographic radius (lat/lng)
- **Cause Area Filtering**: Filter by NTEE codes to find posts from organizations working in specific cause areas
